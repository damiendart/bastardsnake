bastardsnake
============

A snake clone that doesn't want you getting many points.

The only way to play is to build it yourself, an endeavour I wouldn't
recommend wasting your time on. This is one of those projects which I
worked on sporadically and without any particular goals in mind, so
don't expect much.

bastardnake is made with [Haxe][1] and [OpenFL][2]. I've only ever built
Flash and HTML5 versions of the game, so other versions might be funky.
